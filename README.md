### Introduction
MixNote is a note taking app designed to keep track of songs and their multiple versions in-between songwriting and recording sessions.

Easily transfer songs between devices with the download / upload feature, and take advantage of built-in guitar & bass tablature, for recalling any sections that might need to be recorded or overdubbed.

### Development
MixNote was built with HTML5, CSS3 & Vanilla Javascript.

Libraries used:

- [Sortable.js](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) used for easily creating sortable, drag-and-drop containers.
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) used for updating and displaying formatted local dates and times.
- [Guitar Tab Generator](https://codepen.io/jshawl/pen/qNgomR) used as a starting point for the guitar & bass instrument tabs.

### Credits
A **huge** thank you to my [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca/) coach [Eti-abasi Umobong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eti-abasi/) for his support and guidance while I built this.
